# Spotify-Analysis-Proj
## Introduction

This Spotify Analytics Data Engineering project utilizes AWS to build a robust data pipeline for analyzing user behavior, track performance, and artist metrics. Glue ETL handles data transformation, while Athena executes queries, and QuickSight provides real-time visualizations, offering insights into user interactions, track popularity, and album performance.

## Dataset Used 

This project utilizes two Spotify datasets sourced from Kaggle: one capturing user behavior (with columns like `Age`, `Gender`, `skip_rate`, `total_streams`, `total_saves`, and `total_shares`), and another focusing on artist, album, and track information (including `track_name`, `track_popularity`, `album_name`, `release_date`, `label`, and `album_popularity`). Both datasets have been enriched with additional metrics such as `total_album_streams`, `total_album_saves`, and `total_album_shares`, allowing for a more detailed analysis of user interactions, track performance, and artist popularity.
